			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure with uv",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: (1) uv project setup, (2) pyproject.toml configuration, (3) directory structure creation, (4) __init__.py and exports, (5) LICENSE and README.md creation, (6) test scaffolding for structure validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple steps: using a modern package manager (uv), configuring dependencies and dev tools, establishing a directory structure, and ensuring compliance with best practices for Python projects[1][3]. Each step is distinct and requires attention to detail, but the overall complexity is moderate since it follows established conventions."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration System Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Pydantic model design, (2) YAML loader implementation, (3) environment variable override system, (4) configuration merging logic, (5) error handling, (6) TDD test writing for each component, (7) documentation of configuration behaviors.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires designing a robust configuration system with validation, merging, and overrides, all under TDD. It touches on serialization, error handling, and precedence logic, making it more complex than basic setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Logging Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) structured formatter implementation, (2) handler setup (console, file, syslog), (3) log level configuration, (4) context manager for log levels, (5) correlation ID tracking, (6) comprehensive TDD test coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing structured, configurable logging with multiple handlers and context management is moderately complex, especially with requirements for thread safety and extensibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Process Detection Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) abstract interface definition, (2) Unraid-specific implementation, (3) process pattern matching logic, (4) error and permission handling, (5) TDD test suite for interface and implementation, (6) cross-platform considerations.",
			"reasoning": "Abstracting process detection and implementing a system-specific detector with robust error handling and testability is a complex architectural task, especially given the need for extensibility and reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Filesystem Operations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) directory scanning logic, (2) exclusion pattern system, (3) size calculation with caching, (4) symlink and permission error handling, (5) TDD test development for all scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Efficiently scanning directories, handling exclusions, and calculating sizes with caching and error handling is moderately complex, especially when performance and correctness are critical."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Progress Calculation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) progress percentage calculation, (2) transfer rate computation, (3) ETC estimation logic, (4) moving average and history management, (5) comprehensive TDD test suite.",
			"reasoning": "Developing accurate, real-time progress and ETC calculations with robust handling of edge cases and historical data management is moderately complex and algorithmically involved."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop CLI Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) CLI command and option definitions, (2) argument parsing and validation, (3) configuration file support, (4) shell completion and help system, (5) TDD test coverage for CLI behaviors.",
			"reasoning": "While CLI development with Click is straightforward, supporting advanced features like config discovery, dry-run, and shell completion adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Notification Provider Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) abstract provider base class, (2) retry and timeout logic, (3) provider registry system, (4) configuration validation, (5) async dispatch infrastructure, (6) TDD test suite for all components.",
			"reasoning": "Designing an extensible, asynchronous notification system with robust error handling, retries, and a registry pattern is architecturally complex and foundational for plugin extensibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Discord Provider",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) webhook integration, (2) embed generation logic, (3) progress visualization, (4) error and rate limit handling, (5) TDD test coverage for all features.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with Discord webhooks and generating rich embeds is moderately complex, but leverages existing APIs and patterns established by the notification architecture."

			"taskTitle": "Build Monitoring Orchestrator",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) state machine design, (2) event bus implementation, (3) component coordination logic, (4) error and recovery handling, (5) lifecycle management, (6) notification integration, (7) TDD test suite for orchestrator behaviors.",
			"reasoning": "Coordinating all subsystems with a state machine and event-driven architecture is highly complex, requiring careful design for reliability, extensibility, and error recovery."
